! A series of regression models should be estimated. 
! To test for mediation, one should estimate the 3 following regression equations:
! 1) Regressing the mediator on the IV 
! 2) Regressing the DV on the IV
! 3) Regressing the DV on both the IV and on the mediator
! Separate coefficients for each equation should be estimated and tested.
